HTML
    We don't need a server
    Must have .html extension
    Runs in a browser
    index.html is the root/home page of a website

Tag Syntax
    Element names are surrounded by angle brackets <>
    <tagname>content</tagname>
    Normally come in pairs
    <h1>About us</h1>
    Usually with a forward slash

CSS Notes
    Everyone's CSS is different (very free-form design)
    CSS is not a programming language; like HTML it is a language which is used for website layout and design
    It is a stylesheet/styling language, and does not logic in vanilla CSS (Sass can extend logic)

Inline, internal, and external CSS
    - inline is directly in the HTML
    - internal is using <stye> tags within single document
    - external is linking an external .css file

Colors can be hexadecimal, RGB, or regular 'color' denotion

Positioning in CSS can be static, relative, absolute, etc.

JavaScript is high-level and interpreted, does not need to be compiled to run
    Conforms to ECMAScript specification
    Multi-paradigm, meaning many different ways to write (OOP, functional, etc.)
    Runs on the client/browser as well as on the server (Node.js)
    Does extra stuff that pure HTML/CSS cannot do

Why is JavaScript good?
    It's the programming language of the browser unlike Java or Python
    Can be used to make very interactive intefaces such as React, Angular, and Vue
    Can build very fast servide side and full stack applications, as well as apps and desktop apps

JavaScript fundamentals
    Variables and data types
    Arrays, object literals
    Methods for strings, arrays, objects
    Loops and much more

Things to learn after:
    Document Object Model, OOP, Fetch API (all Traversy Media content)
    Framework information such as Vue
